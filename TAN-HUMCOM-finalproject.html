    <h2> Reflection </h2>    
    <p> When I first started taking this course, I was unsure and lack in confidence that my skills in HTML was still even there. 
        Hell, I was worried that I couldn’t pass through this subject cause we had to do HTML and CSS along with the fact I feel 
        pressured from the others as others having a wider and larger experience than I have in coding. I wanna say to myself that 
        I am proud that you know how to code some commands / work in CSS and my knowledge in HTML expanded with different lessons 
        each time I enter this lab and in the classroom, I was able to learn more and more about different ways in designing websites, 
        portfolios, different tech works and ethics. To my past, I am sure that ourselves can be able to code in the present unlike 
        the works at my old institution where they are basic and lacking horrible design and don’t worry, my coding skills are coming 
        back really soon as of now. To the future me, I better see myself knowing how to create websites or develop one, design a 
        website along with the different java code inside in order for it to function as an actual website. I wanted to try to make 
        a portfolio straight up from HTML based on what I learned here in HUMCOM1 and see the fruits of my work. Now, I wanna end 
        this off on a good note so let’s do our best next semester and do well and work well and make THEM proud ok? 
        You understand? Good. I’ll see you next time. </p>
